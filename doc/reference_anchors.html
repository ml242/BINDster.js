<h1>Bookmarks</h1>
<p>Dyanamic applications will often present multiple steps or states.  Rather than each one being a seperate page that is loaded by the browser this often achieved by simply showing and hiding portions of the view.  There are two problems with this
<ul>
	<li>The particular step is not recorded in the URL so you copy the URL and share it</li>
	<li>The back button does not get you to the previous step</li>
</ul>
<p>Bookmarks (named anchors) solve both of these issues and BINDster makes it easy to incorporate them in an application.
</p>
<p>To use this technique place <strong>&lt;a name="hash value url suffix" b:onarrival="code to establish state"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</strong> in front of each state.  The "code to establish state" will generally be code that sets everything needed to put your application in the state it needs to be in.  Then when you want to provide a link that takes you to that particular state you simply go to the "#hash value url suffix".  BINDster will detect that a new URL has is present and execute the "code to establish state".</p>
<p>This documentation uses named anchors to navigate through the document.</p>
<b:code name="reference_anchors" start="1" end="999"></b:code>
<p>A few things to note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The browser will normally try and adjust the scroll position so that the named anchor will be a the top of the display.  To prevent this BINDSter relocates anchors containing the <strong>b:onarrival</strong> attribute as the first children of the body.</li>
	<li>The mechanism works by setting a timer interval and observing changes in the URL that match one of the named anchors with an  <strong>b:onarrival</strong> tag.  This means a few millisecond lag in clicking a link and displaying the state.  Generally this is still much faster than receiving a new page from the web server</li>
</ul>
